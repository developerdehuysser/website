  Constructiv manages a fund for all construction workers in Belgium. They calculate all kind of benefits for these people based on the amount they worked in the past. As their current solution to calculate these benefits exists out of multiple old windows application which are difficult to maintain, they turned to Cegeka to develop a new web-based application to combine the calculation of all these benefits in one solution.

As a coach and architect of the team, I constantly ask myself one question: How can my team create excelling features that provide the greatest amount of business value as speedy as possible.

And choosing the right tool for the right job is fundamental to achieve this goal.
